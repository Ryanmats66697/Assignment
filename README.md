## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ryanmats66697/Assignment.git
   cd Assignment

   
2. **Activate the Pre-configured Virtual Environment**

The repository includes a pre-configured virtual environment (venv), so you donâ€™t need to install the dependencies manually. To activate the virtual environment, use the following commands:

On Linux/Mac:

  bash
  Copy code
  source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

  bash
  Copy code
  venv\Scripts\activate


3. **Database Setup**

The repository includes an SQLite database (db.sqlite3), so no additional database setup is required. You can simply use the existing database.

However, if you want to reset the database or apply new migrations, you can run the following command:

  bash
  Copy code
  python manage.py migrate


4.**Start the Development Server**

After activating the virtual environment and setting up the database, start the Django development server using:

  bash
  Copy code
  python manage.py runserver


5.**Access the Application**

Once the server is running, you can access the application via your web browser. The API and admin interface are available at the following URLs:
